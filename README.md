## How to run
### Windows
If you have windows you must have openGL installed and compile it
Using whatever you like, we suggest the use of [Code Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org)

### Linux
In case you are using Linux (Debian Based) you must run the following commands
before compiling the game

` sudo apt-get install build-essential make libx11-dev libxrandr-dev \
                         libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxcb1-dev libxext-dev \
                         libxrender-dev libxfixes-dev libxau-dev libxdmcp-dev \
                         libmesa-dev libxxf86vm-dev `

and now install OpenGL with

`sudo apt install freeglut3-dev`

then you can just run the game with

`make run`
